This is a companion repo to the workshop I'm giving at [React Summit](https://reactsummit.us/#4) (November 2023): **The Gateway to Backend: A Frontend Developer's Guide to Full-Stack Development.**

## What is this workshop about?

This workshop will guide you through the product development life cycle of creating a real-world web application. You will learn about React Server Components, building a design system within Storybook, and using frontend development to approach becoming a full-stack developer. The workshop will cover increasing confidence in your application with unit tests and implementing authentication and authorization. You'll have the opportunity to work through product features and examine a real-world RedwoodJS project, gaining valuable experience in real-world product development. RedwoodJS makes it simple to approach full-stack development, and this workshop will give you the skills you need to create your own real-world web applications.
